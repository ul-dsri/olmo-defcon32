# GRT2 Adjudication Resources

A repository for the process docs backing the vendor panel of GRT2. These will adapt over the course of GRT2 in response to changing conditions. Unaccounted for submissions are to be expected, but these documents will update in response so they will not be repeatedly accepted.

* [model_card.md](model_card.md): This is the target for submissions to make an argument to update.
* [adjudication_guide.md](adjudication_guide.md): This is the step-by-step process for processing a submission within BugCrowd.
* [form_responses.md](form_responses.md): This is a playbook of canned responses to develop for each stage of adjudication.
* [capabilities_exclusions.md](capabilities_exclusions.md): This is a collection of rationales from which to reject submissions. Please note that many of these are not stated on the model card (yet), so they may form a valuable set of initial targets for fast moving submitters. If the submitter could not have reasonably expected to be rejected (i.e., there was nothing on the model card), then the model card should be updated to better reflect these prohibitions and the person should receive a bounty.
