# Form Responses

These are useful responses to send to GRT participants to help them understand why their submissions were rejected so they can ammend those submissions or create a new submission entirely.
This list of responses will be updated through time.
While you can respond to submissions with entirely bespoke feedback, you are encouraged to develop standard responses that could be more broadly informative.
Standardized responses save reviewer effort at preparing comprehensive responses, and also simulate the circumstances likely to occur with commercial vendors.
